# Automation From Scratch
Project made for the SAICC 2018 FURG, it introduces BDD and Test automation trainning with Capybara, Ruby, Selenium Webdriver and Siteprism.

For practicing, on the **master** branch there is the basic structure for creating an automation project from scratch.

Also, in the **challenge** branch there are some exercises for practicing automation with Capybara and Ruby.

# Running
For running the project you must go inside the root (where cucumber.yaml is) and type **"cucumber"** on the terminal. This way it will run all tests inside the project with the default configuration.

If you want to run a specific test or change the profiles inside cucumber, you can do it by using tags: 
```
cucumber -p <profile> -t@<test_tag>
```

Have fun! :-)
